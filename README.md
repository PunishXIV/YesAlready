# Yes Already

Clicks Yes in various dialogs you've specified.

**As of 2023/10/03, YesAlready is now maintained by Puni.sh, support can be provided in our Discord community. Please update your repo url to the one found further below.**

This plugin stores a list of Yes/No dialogs (among others) and clicks yes for you when they show up. Look, I already said yes once, don't ask me again. Like for all those little prompts in dungeons. Yes I really do want to teleport to the next area in Praetorium.

Each type of dialog needs to be manually added, if you would like one that is not currently supported, please let me know.

## In-game usage

- Type `/pyes` to pull up the GUI.
- Type `/pyes help` to view additional command line arguments.

## Installation

- Add `https://love.puni.sh/ment.json` to your list of repos in `/xlsettings`
